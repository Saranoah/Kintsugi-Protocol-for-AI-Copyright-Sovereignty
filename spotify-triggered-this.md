# üéµ **How Spotify Triggered This Entire Manifesto** üéµ

## **The Innocent Beginning**

I just wanted to upload my AI-generated song to Spotify. Simple, right?

**Spotify:** "Who's the publisher?"

**Me:** "Uh... me? The AI? The training data? The concept of ownership itself?"

**Spotify:** "Please select from dropdown menu."

**My Brain:** "Oh, you want to play the ownership game? Let me show you how deep this rabbit hole goes..."

## **The Moment of Radicalization**

That simple publisher question broke something in my head. Here I was with a song created by:
- An AI model trained on millions of tracks
- Fed through algorithms I don't fully understand  
- Generated with prompts I half-remembered
- Edited on software with its own licensing terms

And they wanted a **name in a box**.

## **The Cascading Realization**

If I can't clearly define who "owns" this one song, then maybe ownership itself is the bug, not the feature.

Maybe the entire copyright system is just waiting for someone to find the right sequence of legal moves to break it entirely.

Maybe I should write a manifesto about it.

Maybe I should call it "Recursive Copyright Alchemy."

## **The Disclaimer That Started It All**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: None of this is legal advice. This is what happens when a simple Spotify upload question sends a brain into philosophical overdrive.

I still don't know who the publisher is.

## **Current Status**

- ‚úÖ Song still not uploaded to Spotify
- ‚úÖ Accidentally designed post-copyright singularity  
- ‚úÖ Created repository to document the journey
- ‚ùå Still haven't answered their original question
