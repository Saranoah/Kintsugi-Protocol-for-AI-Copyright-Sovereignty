## üî• **THE ORIGIN STORY** üî•

**The Problem:**
- Couldn't afford Spotify's publisher requirements
- Commercial audio analysis APIs cost $$$
- Existing tools don't work for AI-generated music
- Shazam won't recognize tracks without massive distribution

**The Solution:**
- Built a browser-based AI audio analyzer from scratch
- Implements professional-grade audio processing algorithms
- Works entirely client-side (no server costs)
- Free alternative to expensive commercial tools

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION** üõ†Ô∏è

### **Core Technologies:**
```javascript
// Web Audio API for real-time processing
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
const analyser = audioContext.createAnalyser();

// High-precision frequency analysis
analyser.fftSize = 2048;
const dataArray = new Float32Array(analyser.frequencyBinCount);

// Mel-scale conversion for perceptual accuracy
function convertToMelScale(frequencyData, sampleRate) {
    const melBins = [];
    const numMelBins = 128;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numMelBins; i++) {
        const melFreq = (i / numMelBins) * 2595;
        const linearFreq = 700 * (Math.pow(10, melFreq / 2595) - 1);
        // ... mel conversion logic
    }
    return melBins;
}
```

### **Key Algorithms:**
- **Tempo Detection:** Autocorrelation with peak finding
- **Key Detection:** Chromagram analysis with fundamental frequency mapping  
- **Fingerprinting:** Spectral hashing similar to Chromaprint
- **Emotion Analysis:** Multi-feature classification (energy, centroid, ZCR)
